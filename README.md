# ERP_Automation

## To read the data from the ERP downloaded attendance excel/csv sheet and update the marks of evaluation sheet (experiment_1.xlsxâ€¦etc) as per the attendance record.

As a educator, I need to continously assess the students based on thier practical performance for the final University Term Work Marks.

I have been assigned the Aritficial Intelligence Lab (Second Year Engginering) which containts 10 Practicals. 

We have tow divisions for the second year with the class strength 70 each.

It's been very hectic to see the atteandace of every student and accordingly update the Coninuous Evaluation Sheet Marks for each practical.

Now see the scenario - Approximately 140 students, each is having 10 Practicals, and I have to update the marks of these students for each practical.

The Rubrics decided for the Pracitcal Assesment are as follows:

- Timely completion,punctuality
  
- Performance/involvement/efficiency
  
- Oral/Presentation
  
- Documentation/neatness
  
Means for each practical with these for rubrics total marks to be updated in Continuous Evaluation Sheet which is iterative and time consuming.

Idnetifying this problem, 

- I designed this automation script, which will take the attedance csv file and Expeirment Blank Evaluation Excel sheet as input.
  
- Based on atteadnce present in attednance csv file Evaluation sheet is updated.
